# Atlas Streams

Atlas Streams will introduce new extensions to the MongoDB aggregation language
These additions are designed for building aggregations on boundless streams of data 

It’s built on the document model, allowing for flexibility when dealing with the nested and complex data structures common in event streams. This alleviates the need for pre-processing steps while allowing developers to work naturally and easily with data that has complex structures. Just as the database allows.

It unifies the experience of working across all data, offering a single platform – across API, query language, and tools – to process rich, complex streaming data alongside the critical application data in your database.

And it’s fully managed in MongoDB Atlas, building on an already robust set of integrated services. With just a few API calls and lines of code, you can stand up a stream processor, database, and API serving layer across any of the major cloud providers.
